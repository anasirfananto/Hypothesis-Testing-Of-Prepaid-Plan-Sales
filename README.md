# Hypothesis-Testing-Of-Prepaid-Plan-Sales
# Project Description
You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The advertising department wants to know which prepaid plan generates more revenue to adjust the advertising budget.
You will conduct an initial analysis of the prepaid plans based on a relatively small sample of clients. You will have data on 500 Megaline clients: who they are, where they are from, what type of plan they use, and the number of calls and messages they sent in 2018. Your task is to analyze client behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more income.
# Prepaid Package Description
Note: Megaline rounds seconds to minutes, as well as megabytes to gigabytes. For calls, each individual call is rounded up: even if the call lasts only one second, it will count as one minute. For web traffic, each web session is not rounded up. However, totals for a month are rounded up. If a user spends 1025 megabytes this month, then he will be charged for 2 gigabytes.
